This project uses D3 and Javascript to display various countries in different sizes depending on their land mass. Who doesn't like viewing all countries in a single page, right? The data is in a JSON format which can be parsed through including other information about a country.
Countries are also colour (sorry... It's Canada) coded based on their geographical region (continents).
